                John proposed on a hike to Tamawanas Falls at the base of Mt Hood on a road trip back from spending
                Christmas in the bay area. When we got to the falls, there was another proposal being set up, replete
                with twinkle lights, a wooden arch, and rose petals scattered on the ground. Not one for being predictable,
                John thought "soft pass" and waited until he and Kari were almost back at the car before he pulled her
                down on the banks of a river near the trail head and popped the question. They each found the other
                acceptable, and decided to spend the rest of their lives together.
